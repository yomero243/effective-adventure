# ADR 1: Implementing 3D Interactive Portfolio with Three.js, React, and GSAP

## Status
Accepted

## Context
- Need for a modern, engaging portfolio website
- Desire to showcase technical skills in 3D web development
- Requirements for smooth animations and interactive elements
- Need for maintainable and scalable architecture
- Goal to stand out from traditional portfolio websites

## Decision
We will implement the portfolio using:
1. React (v18+) as the main framework
   - Benefits: Component reusability, efficient DOM updates
   - Context API for state management
2. Three.js for 3D graphics
   - React Three Fiber for React integration
   - Custom 3D models and scenes
3. GSAP for animations
   - ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll-based animations
   - Timeline for sequenced animations
4. Build tools:
   - Vite for fast development
   - TailwindCSS for styling
5. Architecture:
   - Separate concerns between 3D scene and UI components
   - Custom hooks for Three.js logic
   - Modular component structure

## Consequences
### Positive
- Rich, interactive user experience
- Better showcase of technical capabilities
- Modular and maintainable codebase
- Optimized performance with modern tools

### Challenges
- Higher initial learning curve
- More complex state management
- Needs careful performance optimization
- Requires 3D asset management
- Mobile performance considerations
